I love learning new skills, technologies, and ideas so I can write about them.

My focus is getting the right information to the right audience at the right 
time. I believe that people learn by doing, not by reading. Docs need to 
support doing and have tangible outcomes for users quickly.

Before I began writing for a living, I taught high school for two years. 
Before that, I studied physics.
