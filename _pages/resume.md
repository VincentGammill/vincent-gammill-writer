## Education
B.A. Physics, [Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu/), 2014  
4.0 GPA, _Phi Beta Kappa_, _Summa Cum Laude_

## Experience
### Technical Writer | [Epic Systems](https://www.epic.com/) 
_11/2017 - Present_  
For software critical to patient care and hospital revenue at large health 
systems, I helped users learn about
- New features and configuration options
- Automatic changes in a highly regulated industry
- User interface changes that required training

I collaborated with development teams that created software for creating 
medical insurance claims and exchanging patient data with external systems.

I transferred to my team on short notice after both writers for that team 
left the company. I covered the work alone for three months and met all 
documentation deadlines.

### Science Teacher | [Little Rock Central High](https://www.lrcentralhigh.net/) 
_08/2015 - 05/2017_  
While teaching chemistry and physics, I fostered an inclusive and supportive 
learning environment for students with diverse needs. I engaged parents 
whenever student success was at risk.

## Soft Skills
- I keep asking questions until I understand.
- I use direct and concise language.
- I speak in front of groups confidently.
- I work best in a collaborative environment. 
- My favorite work experiences involve both learning and teaching.
