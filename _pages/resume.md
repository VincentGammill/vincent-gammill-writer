## Experience
### Technical Writer | [Epic Systems](https://www.epic.com/) 
11/2017 - Present 
As a member of the integration engineering team and the electronic insurance 
team, I:
- Collaborated with subject matter experts from engineering, design, testing, 
support, and sales to define document needs and strategic priorities.
- Planned, authored, and maintained guides and release notes for customer IT 
teams as well as technical API documentation for internal support, customer 
IT, and third-party software vendors.
- Designed processed and tools for document maintenance and publication.
- Created authoring guidelines for both web docs and in-system text.
- Worked with engineers and testers to sharpen system text and improve the user 
experience, focusing on concision and designed that reduced the need for text.
- Created promotional documents, video scripts, and feature walkthroughs as 
needed.

I moved to my current team after both writers for that team left the company. 
I covered the work alone for three months and met all documentation deadlines.
