## Explore and Edit Messages Using Your Keyboard
Whether you want to go mouse-free or learn to make the most common moves more 
quickly, the keyboard has everything you need to use electronic messages. 

### In Our Desktop App
When you open the activity, the message content is outlined to show it is 
selected and the first segment or element of the message is highlighted. You 
can press: 
- **Arrow Keys** to highlight different fields or elements in the message.
- **Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow** to expand a highlighted segment or element 
  vertically, and **Ctrl+Shift+Up Arrow** to collapse it again.
- **Alt+E** to enable editing the message. When editing is enabled, you can 
  press **Enter** to start editing the content of a highlighted field. To 
  stop editing and save your work, you can press **Tab** or **Enter**. 
  - Just like the Edit button, all the activity toolbar buttons have their 
  hotkey an marked with an underlined letter in the label. Press 
  **Alt+\<the underlined letter\>** to activate that button with the keyboard.
- **Tab** to move the focus to other parts of the screen. For example, if you 
  want to move the focus to the Reference Guides section without the mouse, 
  keep pressing **Tab** until the linked reference guide is outlined to show 
  it is selected. 

### In Our Browser App

The shortcut keys are the same as in the desktop app, with two differences: 
- You can press **Ctrl+Down Arrow** to expand a highlighted segment or element 
  vertically, and **Ctrl+Up Arrow** to collapse it again. 
- **Alt+Shift+E** to enable editing the message. When editing is enabled, 
  you can press **Enter** to start editing the content of a highlighted field. 
  To stop editing and save your work, you can press **Tab** or **Enter**.
  - Just like the Edit button, all the activity toolbar buttons have their 
  hotkey marked with an underlined letter in the label. Press 
  **Alt+Shift+\<The underlined letter\>** to activate that button with the 
  keyboard.
